"""suppose all the students are studying in the same school,
so we don't need to parameterized again again 
like self.school_name="abc"
we can creat a variable before create a init function.

if we creat another variable named:
name = "abcd..."
name is also an attribute in self parameter
self.name = fullname
then which will be work
abcd... or Joy D@s
here name="abcd..." is a class attribute
and self.name is a object attribute
obj attr > class attr
so Joy D@s will be print
